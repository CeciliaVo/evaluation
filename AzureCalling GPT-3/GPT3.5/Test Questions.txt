Question 1 (8 pts)
Prompt the user to enter three float numbers, check if among them, a number is the sum of other two numbers or not, and print out a YES/NO message as below:
Sample Run:

Question 2 (8 pts)
Write a program which keeps asking the user to input an even integer, then calculate and print out the sum of all even values from 0 to that number. The program stops when the user inputs an odd integer and print out an error message as below:
Sample Run:
Enter an even integer: 6
Sum of all even values from 0 to 6 is: 12
Enter an even integer: 10
Sum of all even values from 0 to 10 is: 30
Enter an even integer: 3
It is not an even integer.
Explanation: Sum of all even values from 0 to 10 is:  0 + 2 + 4 + â€¦ + 10 = 30

Question 3 (9 pts)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer between 1 and 10 inclusively. Then nicely displays a pattern as shown below. 
Enter a number (1 - 10): 10
                            10
                          9 10  9
                       8  9 10     8
                    7  8  9 10        7
                 6  7  8  9 10           5
              5  6  7  8  9 10              4
           4  5  6  7  8  9 10                 3
        3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10                    2
     2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10                       1
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
